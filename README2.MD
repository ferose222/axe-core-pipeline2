i am avble to compile the code with mvn clean install , npm start in selenium folder
i need to add the steps of accessibility testing as a stage in jenkins pipeline and that stage should pull the docker image and run a container to perform the accessiblity testing on the code or the url whihc I am not sure , can youpls let me know how I can implement this

I have compiled the code with mvn clean install and npm start in selenium and playwright, not sure how this code perfoms the accessibilty test and how I can implement a jenkins pipeline,with the accessibilt test as a stage that runs a docker conatiner to perform the test
can you pls analyze how this code analyzes teh code and how we can use this to run teh accessiblity test in a jenkins pipeilne as stage with docker

How the axe-core-maven-html Project Performs Accessibility Testing
This project integrates Deque’s axe-core accessibility engine with Maven for testing web applications. Here's an overview of its working mechanism:

Setup:

It leverages Selenium or Playwright to control browsers and access web pages.
The tests extract the page’s HTML content and pass it to axe-core, which runs accessibility checks.
Execution:

When running mvn clean install, the Maven configuration executes unit or integration tests that use Selenium WebDriver or Playwright to load web pages.
The axe-core script (often injected into the browser via WebDriver) scans for accessibility issues.
Results are logged or reported as part of the build process.
Report:

The output will display any violations found by axe-core. This can include issues like missing ARIA labels, poor contrast ratios, or invalid HTML structures.

How to Implement Jenkins Pipeline with Docker for Accessibility Tests
Here’s a step-by-step approach to implementing a Jenkins pipeline that runs these tests inside a Docker container.

Dockerfile Setup
First, create a Dockerfile that installs all the necessary dependencies to run the tests.


FROM maven:3.8.4-openjdk-17 AS builder

# Install Node.js (if needed for npm start)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl \
    && curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | bash - \
    && apt-get install -y nodejs

# Copy the project files into the container
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
RUN mvn clean install

# Optional: Start the npm server if needed for Playwright/Selenium
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["npm", "start"]
=============================

Jenkins Pipeline Configuration
Create a Jenkinsfile to define your pipeline. Here's an example:


pipeline {
    agent {
        docker {
            image 'your-docker-repository/axe-core-maven-html:latest' 
            args '-p 8080:8080'
        }
    }
    environment {
        MAVEN_OPTS = "-Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=/usr/local/bin/chromedriver"
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core-maven-html'
            }
        }
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'mvn clean install'
            }
        }
        stage('Run Accessibility Tests') {
            steps {
                script {
                    try {
                        sh 'mvn test'
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        echo "Accessibility tests failed: ${e}"
                        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            archiveArtifacts artifacts: '**/target/*.xml', allowEmptyArchive: true
            junit '**/target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
        }
    }
}
==================

Explanation of the Jenkins Pipeline
Docker Agent:
This pipeline uses a Docker container as the build environment. Replace your-docker-repository/axe-core-maven-html:latest with the appropriate Docker image name.

Checkout Stage:
Jenkins clones the repository containing the axe-core-maven-html project.

Build Stage:
This step runs mvn clean install to compile the code and install dependencies.

Accessibility Test Stage:

It uses mvn test to run accessibility tests via Selenium/Playwright.
If any accessibility violations are detected, the build is marked as FAILURE.
Post Actions:

Archives artifacts from the build, including test reports.
Runs junit to publish the test results for easy viewing in Jenkins.

Docker Container Build and Push
Build the Docker image:

docker build -t your-docker-repository/axe-core-maven-html:latest .

Push the Docker image to a repository (e.g., DockerHub or your private registry):

docker push your-docker-repository/axe-core-maven-html:latest


Final Steps
Set up Jenkins:

Install the Docker Pipeline plugin on Jenkins.
Ensure Jenkins can access your Docker registry and pull the necessary images.
Configure Jenkins to use a Docker agent with the docker argument set for containers.
Run the Pipeline:
Start the pipeline. Jenkins will pull the Docker image, execute the tests, and display the results.

This setup ensures that accessibility tests are consistently run as part of your CI/CD process. The Jenkins pipeline will fail if any accessibility issues are found, making it easy to catch issues early.
